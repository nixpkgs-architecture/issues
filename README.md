# Nixpkgs Architecture Team Issues

This repository was used to track issues that the [Nixpkgs Architecture Team](https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture) might consider solving.

Since the team is [now dissolved](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixpkgs-architecture-team-conclusion-and-prospective/41020), all issues have been transferred [to Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aarchitecture).
